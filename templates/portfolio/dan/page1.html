		<div>
			Someone who knew me well once described me as a problem solving and efficiency expert.  I excel at finding solutions; whether by contracting/collaborating with the proper resources, or using my own technical background and expertise to solve the issue first hand.  I have experience managing teams of up to 20, documenting and analyzing large scale business projects, and personally designing business automation to improve efficiency.  No matter the challenge, I face it head on without hesitation.
