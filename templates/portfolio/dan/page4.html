			<h1>Overview</h1>
			<p>I started my coding journey in 2009 at InFocus Corporation. I was the Call Center Manager at that time and the company was unwilling to pay the cost for an enterprise ticketing system for the agents.  Instead the people in the call center were forced to enter information into SharePoint, which was slow, prone to bugs, and provided NO usability enhancements.  I decided if InFocus wasn't going to pay for one, then I would develop one. I ended up with a combination on Excel, MySQL, and PHP that was highly functional, though not very pretty or complex.  Over the next 4 years of managing the call center the tool grew and adapted, eventually discarding Excel for a web interface.  By the end of that 4 years I had developed a variety of solutions for problems in and out of my own department, and the company was convinced I was being under-utilized as the call center manager.  They moved me into a development roll and I have loved every minute of it.</p>
			<p>The 5 years since becoming a full-time developer have allowed for a lot of growth and self education.  I started with just PHP back in 2009, but I was ravenous for more capability.  I followed (what I imagine to be) a rather normal progression adding HTML, CSS, and Javascript before looking at more advanced libraries that had come out in the meantime.  While PHP remained my foundation I have toyed with NodeJS and Java as new languages, and would love the chance to work with them in an upcoming position.</p>
			<p>Currently I work as a Full Stack Developer for Blue Star Sports. This position was supposed to be contract (6mo) to hire, but the company made the decision to move operations down to Texas.  Since I am not willing to relocate to Texas I am on the job hunt again already.  This position, however, has given me something I was severely lacking in: large-scale collaborative development.  At InFocus I was a "One Man Show".  I worked with contractors occasionally, but I was the only developer on most projects and so my experience with more realistic development environments was extremely limited and, I can be honest, it was intimidating.  Since starting in this environment (with a brief period of adjustment), I love the work.  The ability to bounce ideas off my neighbors is invaluable, and the investigation of bugs in a large scale business application is challenging and interesting.  While I will not turn down a position where I am the sole developer at the company, I find I prefer this type of environment.</p>

				GameMaster.Pro is a web application designed to make Game Masters' daunting task of creating a rich and intricate world a little easier.  As well as make the mechanics of game run a little smoother. GMP was designed as an app, not a webpage so it is what I would call a "minimalist" design.  The goal was to pack as much information into the space as possible.
			</p>
			<br>
			<h3>Here are some features of Game Master Pro:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Support for up to 7.1 surround sound scenes for an immersive experience
				</li>
				<li>
					Pre-designs "Soundscapes" for common RPG Scenarios
				</li>
				<li>
					Soundscapes can have "on the fly" changes; removing specific optional effects or changing volumes.
				</li>
				<li>
					Design custom soundscapes for your own use, or share them with the community!
				</li>
				<li>
					The "World Generator" creates NPC's not only with names and descriptions, but families, friends, professions, and much much more.  You'll know your NPC's better than you know your neighbors!!
				</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>List of planned upgrades:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Custom Skinning
				</li>

				<h2>Anbient Noise Player</h2>
				<h4 class="text-center row">
					<div class="col-xs-4">

					</div>
				</h4>
				<div>
					One of the most unique parts of this software, the ambient noise player allows you to build fully immersive ambient sound schemes from a library of individual sound effects. The output is in 7.1 surround and includes localized sound effects (ex. a bird call that comes from random direction/distance), looping background ambience, and "optional" effects that can be enabled or disabled on the fly.
				</div>
				<strong>Interesting Hurdles</strong>
				<p><strong>Tracking start and end times:</strong> Each sound effect has a different duration, and has different "delay" ranges anywhere from -60 - 600 seconds.  This delay is (generally) randomized between a high and a low limit. Once the track starts playing, the "next play" has to be caluclated and stored. In the case of negative numbers this means the sound can play again before the first play is even finished, overlapping the sound effects.</p>
				<p><strong>Audio Context instances:</strong> Only 6 audio context instances can be in existance at any time.  So each scene being played uses a single context (and merges the sounds together).  However since these sound effects need to have fade in AND fade out capability, each time a sound is played it needs to be assigned a gain node. This node is stored in an array, but it can get quite large because the node isn't removed once the sound is finished playing. I will be working on a better way to handle this in the next version.</p>
				<strong>What I'm not proud of</strong>
				<p>There is some sloppy scope usage that grew out of hand. That is part of the reasoning for switching to ReactJS w/ Redux. Also, the sound management feels very messy. I want a cleaner system that is more structured and has some garbage management.</p>

				<div>
					The world simulator was a very fun and challenging part of this project. The system allows for you to enter parameters for your "world" and it will generate NPCs (characters/people that live in the world). These NPCs would live their lives, get married, have kids, start occupations, and die.  All of which is tracked and calculated based on chance.  
				</div>
				<strong>Interesting Hurdles</strong>
				<p><strong>Life and Death:</strong> The goal was for the "world" to take on a life of its own. This happened in a very real way. A good chunk of time was spent balancing birth and death rates so the size of the population wouldn't grow exponentially, but also wouldn't die out.  I "killed" many civilizations fine tuning this.  In the end I added a bit of "protection" code that changed the birth and death rates when populations became exceptionally high or exceptionally low.</p>
				<p><strong>Research:</strong> I wanted some semblance of realism so I included things like same sex relationships, childbirth out of marriage (though, more common if married), and spinsters that never marry.  I ended up doing a lot of research on average statistics for these calculations.</p>
				<p><strong>Mixing Races:</strong> The design of this system is based on a fantasy world so the idea of differnt races having children together made me want to represent that in code.  So, for example, when a Human and an Elf have a child, it is a Half-Elf.  This was interesting to code, and fun to work out</p>
				<strong>What I'm not proud of</strong>
				<p>There are definitely some efficiency upgrades that could have been done, and many of the SQL queries would be better served as stored procedured</p>

					Map navigator allows uploaded images to be navigated via googleMaps api. Locations can be added with HTML notes to keep all the information you need right at your fingertips.
				</div>
				<strong>Interesting Hurdles</strong>
				<p><strong>Map Scope:</strong> Since the mapped images are much smaller than googleMaps api was designed for, I saw some odd side effects that I have not yet been able to overcome.  The primary one is the "repeat" of the "locations" on the map, so if you scrolled too far to the right or the left you saw location icons floating in the background off the side of the main map.</p>
				<p><strong>Note at zoom level:</strong> I wanted the ability for different "layers" of notes, so more detailed information can be shown when the map is zoomed in.</p>
				<strong>What I'm not proud of</strong>
				<p>The use of the API itself is a little clumsy since I'm trying to warp it to my purpose.  I'm thinking it may be better to code my own custom mapping system since there is so much in googleMaps api that I don't need/use.</p>

					This is the internal site for InFocus Corporation. It is used for custom internal tools that I developed for the company over the years. These tools range from marketing, pricing, logistics, and the call center. Some of these tools were developed to replace costly or obsolete software/processes, and some were original ideas to increase general efficiency and cost effectiveness.

				<strong>Interesting Hurdles</strong>
				<p><strong>Office 365 OAuth:</strong> Rather than creating a system where the users had to remember ANOTHER username and password I wanted to tie in our office 365 logins.  The problem is that CraftCMS does not support alternate login systems/credentials.  I had to get a bit creative in order to get the system to work, but once completed the integration was seemless.</p>

				This custom pricing tool was designed to replace the process of emailing excel spreadsheets back and forth. The reason it had not been replaced years ago by an OTB tool is because it was/is rediculously complex.  They have 12 different pricelists for their customer set each with their own rules, columns, and products.  Plus, they wanted a whole host of tracking and analysis added on.
			</div>
			<strong>Interesting Hurdles</strong>
			<p><strong>Complex Design</strong> The list of requirements on this project was a mile long.  The owners wanted something that was incredibly customizeable so it would account for any future iterations of changes. Just conceptualizing a system with so many moving parts was a challenge.  Once I got the basic structure down however, it was much easier to progress.</p>
			<strong>What I'm not proud of</strong>
			<p>In the end I was able to deliver above and beyond what they requested, but the complexity and ability to customize everything made for a software that had a steeper learning curve.</p>

					The German version of this site can still be viewed at <a href="www.infocus.de">www.infocus.de</a> (at the time of writing this). The story behind this is it was supposed to be a temporary site.  The whole thing was developed very rapidly (2 months), and the focus was on easy maintainability so the marketing team could focus most of their attention on the development of the NEW new site. That "temporary site" ended up being used for 6 years (and counting for the German site).  So something that was tossed together very quickly, and included a custom CMS, held up surprisingly well given the number of changes and customization that were seen in that 6 year period.
				</div>
				<strong>What I'm not proud of</strong>
				<p>Given that this was my very first project of this scale, and I had done nothing even close to its scope before, there was a lot I'm not particularly proud of.  By the end of the 6 years it had so much "duct-tape" for all the un-intended customizations.  However for what it was meant to be, a quickly built site with a custom CMS, it served very well. </p>
				<strong>Code</strong>
				<p>Ok, I lied, no code here.  I was going to find a piece of good code to include on this page, but the site is fairly massive, and there isn't a lot that stands out as "impressive" work.  Most of the time I was on a "this needs to be done yesterday" time frame so I rarely had time to do things properly.  I learned to code quickly, but made plenty of shortcuts.  If you do want to see the code you are welcome to peruse the Github repository.</p>

			<h2>Upgrade GameMaster.Pro to ReactJS</h2>
			<div>
				<span>The first version of GameMaster.Pro was very functional, but it had its share of "hacks", and hiccups.  Now that I have a better idea of what the end product will be I want to re-code the system in ReactJS.  React (likely with redux and react router) will give a more finely tuned system, and I like the component management it allows for.</span>

				<h4>Task List</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Break-down the site into components and sub-components
					</li>
					<li>
						Re-write ambient noise controller
					</li>
					<li>
						Write timeline plugin that will allow for custom year/month length
					</li>
					<li>
						Integrate Character creator tool (partnered with Alex Warnes)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</div>

			<h2>Modern/Post apocalyptic game interface</h2>
			<div>
				<span>This would be another system to enhance tabletop roleplaying.  It would be interesting and fun in any post electronics age game, to have a reseach interface that the GM could plug campaign details into.  The players could then use search terms or navigation to try to dig up these details.  Rather than a GM just giving them a piece of paper or reading them what they find.  This would provide a little more tactile experience and provide more things for the players to interact over</span>
				<h4>Task List</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Design front end interface(s).
					</li>
					<li>
						Easy data entry for information the PC's can find.
					</li>
					<li>
						Some type of "invalid" or "not-useful" results other than just "nothing found"
					</li>
					<li>
						Possible Additions
						<ul>
							<li>
								Hacking type mini-game
							</li>
							<li>
								System breaking mid search
